# RecapNewsApp
RSS NEWS FEED!!! 
I used an existing opensource parseloginexample for user login and sign up.
I then followed the tutorial: http://techiedreams.com/android-simple-rss-reader/
to create an RSS news app!!
I'm using the website : Times of India for ALL my news feeds!
The public rss feed in my app is from NDTV!!!

This app allows you to read offline, swipe through the news, and choose what to read!!
